## Overview

This software provides an environment to build a zone detection system using the AITRIOS&trade; platform.

## Prerequisite

The following service and edge AI device are required to run this software:

- Buy Developer Edition Basic Plan
- Buy edge AI device
- Buy Azure account and subscription

## Setup Guide

Here are the setup procedures for using this software.

### 1. Set up your device

Configure the edge AI device you purchased.

See the ["**Device Setup Guide**"](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/documents/device-setup-guide) for details on the following procedures.

- Obtaining device certificates 
- Register the edge AI device 
- Connecting the edge AI device to Console 
- Updating the edge AI device firmware 
- Installing the edge AI device

### 2. Set up and deploy AI model

Set up an AI model to use for zone detection and deploy it to edge AI device.

See the ["**Console User Manual**"](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/documents/console-user-manual) for details on the following procedures.

- Create model
- Train model

The images for training are available by downloading the following ZIP file.

- [training_images.zip](./sample/training_images.zip)

### 3. Set up and deploy "**Vision and Sensing Application**"

Build a "**Vision and Sensing Application**" for zone detection and deploy it to edge AI device.

See the ["**README**"](./sample/README.md) for details on procedures.

### 4. Deploy Azure resources

Use the Azure Portal and an ARM template to deploy your Azure resources. </br> 
You can also set up a connection with the "**Console**" and configure applications at the same time.

See the ["**README**"](./deploy/README.md) for details on procedures.

## Tutorials
